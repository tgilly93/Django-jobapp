You've reached the end of
this React Basics course. You've worked hard
to get here and developed a lot of new
skills along the way. You're making great progress
on your react journey. You are able to demonstrate some of this learning along with your practical React basic
skill sets in the Lab project. Following your completion of
this course in React basics, you should now be able to
create a simple calculator app. Your calculator should
be able to perform the four basic
mathematical operations; addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The lab not only gave you the practical
experience you needed, but it also has another
important benefit. You now have a fully operational calculator
built-in React, that you can reference
within your portfolio. This serves to demonstrate your skills to
potential employers. Not only does it
show employers that you are self-driven
and innovative, but it also speaks volumes
about you as an individual, as well as your newly
obtained knowledge. What are the next steps? In this course, you
were introduced to several key topics that can help you on your
learning journey. You probably realized that there's still more
for you to learn. As you continue
through the program, you'll develop your skill sets. If you found this course helpful and wants to discover more, then why not register
for the next course. Once you've
successfully completed all the courses in this program, you'll receive a
certificate that you can use to validate
your achievements. The certification
can also be used as a progression to other meta
role-based certifications. Depending on your goals, you may choose to go deep with advanced role-based
certifications, or take other
fundamental courses once you earn it
this certification. Meta certifications provide
a globally recognized and industry endorsed evidence
of your technical skills. Thank you. It's
been a pleasure to embark on this journey
of discovery with you. Best of luck in the future.
